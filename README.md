# 📈 Time-Based Value Prediction (Linear Regression)

This project demonstrates a simple yet practical **time-series value prediction model** using **Linear Regression** in Python.  
It predicts the next value in a sequence based on historical data, showing how machine learning can be applied to trend forecasting.

##  Overview

Businesses often need to forecast values such as:
- future sales
- stock demand
- performance growth
- KPI trends

This mini-project provides a foundational example of predicting future values based on time (t) as a feature and a numerical target variable.

---

##  How It Works

1. Load a dataset representing values over time  
2. Train a Linear Regression model from scikit-learn  
3. Predict the next data point in the sequence  

✔️ This pipeline can be extended to real-world datasets with minor modifications.
